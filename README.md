# Length-Weight-Relationships

Modeling the relationship between length and weight of a species of fish 

The relationship between the length and weight of a  sh is used by  sheries researchers and managers for
two main purposes (Le Cren 1951). First, the relationship is used to predict the weight from the length of a
fish.  
This is particularly useful for computing the biomass of a sample of  sh from the length-frequency of
that sample. Second, the parameter estimates of the relationship for a population of  sh can be compared to
average parameters for the region, parameter estimates from previous years, or parameter estimates among
groups of  sh to identify the relative condition or robustness of the population.
